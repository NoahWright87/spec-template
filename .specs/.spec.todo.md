Top priorities to tackle next and why they matter.
Use **H2 headings** for each priority, in priority order.

### <Priority Name>

- Partial design thoughts
- Why it's not a current priority

## Backlog
Longer-term plans in rough priority order.
Minimal detail is fine.

## Ideas (Uncommitted)
Wild ideas, experiments, or "wouldn't it be cool if..."
These may never ship, and that's fine.
