# Ideas intake

Too lazy to search for the right spec to update?  Throw your idea here and let the LLMs put it in the right place(s) later!

## AGENTS Instructions

When asked to, take any items listed below and organize put them into the appropriate TODO spec file.  Ideas may be vague, rambling, or half-baked.  If necessary, ask clarifying questions to determine the user's intent.  If a single item refers to multiple components or is a particularly large/complex idea, it can be broken into multiple separate TODOs in the relevant `*.todo.spec`.

Use your best judgement to determine the priority of each item.  If a requested item already exists in the TODO spec, that implies a higher priority.  If a high priority item is lacking details, always ask the user for more information.  If priority is not very clear, ask the user.

When you have emptied the submissions section below, leave behind a single bullet:
